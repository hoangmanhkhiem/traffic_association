Easily set up cookie banner or cookie notice and cookie policy page for GDPR (DSGVO, RGPD) compliance. Also supports CCPA/CPRA and other major global laws.

== Description ==

The CookieYes plugin enables seamless cookie consent and GDPR compliance by integrating an intuitive cookie banner into your website. It offers full support for GDPR (DSGVO, RGPD) and CCPA/CPRA to easily obtain user consent for cookies, ensuring legal compliance.

Customizable cookie banner designs and options make configuring a GDPR-compliant cookie consent solution simple. The plugin also supports various other global privacy regulations beyond GDPR, including LGPD (Brazil), CNIL (France), PIPEDA (Canada), Law 25 (Quebec), POPIA (South Africa), nFADP (Switzerland), Privacy Act (Australia), PDPL (Saudi Arabia), PDPL (Argentina), PDPL (Andorra), DPA (Faroe Islands), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA). Additionally, it's designed to align with significant state privacy laws in the US, such as VCDPA (Virginia), CPA (Colorado), CTDPA (Connecticut), and UCPA (Utah).

Our cookie plugin ranks among the top WordPress solutions for cookie compliance and is certified by Google, providing a comprehensive suite of features, including policy page generators.

== Key Features == 

- **Cookie consent banner**: The plugin will enable a cookie consent banner with Accept and Reject options.

- **Customization**: Customize the cookie notice style so it blends with your existing website: change the colors, fonts, styles, position on the page, and even how it behaves when you click “Accept All”.

- **Preference center**: Offer a second layer of control through a preference center within the banner. Allow site visitors to provide granular consent for specific cookie categories, giving them the choice to opt in or opt-out.

- **Revisit consent button**: Visitors can either permanently dismiss the cookie banner or access it later through a revisit consent button, which can be tailored in terms of color and position.

- **Consent logging**: Log users' consent and export it into a CSV file.

- **CCPA/CPRA opt-out**: The plugin can be configured to have a CCPA/CPRA ‘Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information’ control on the cookie notice.

= NOTE: INSTALLING THIS PLUGIN ALONE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SITE GDPR AND CCPA COMPLIANT. SINCE EACH SITE USES DIFFERENT COOKIES, YOU NEED TO ENSURE YOU HAVE THE NECESSARY CONFIGURATIONS IN PLACE WITH A SUPPORTING COOKIE NOTICE. = 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The cookie notice header doesn’t work on my browser =
Please report a bug on the support forum. Make sure to include the following information:

* Your URL (We need it to help you!)
* WordPress version (found in the bottom right-hand corner of the dashboard)
* Browser where the issue is observed (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, IE)
* Describe the problem. The more information you provide, the faster we can respond.


= What does this plugin do? =
This WordPress cookie plugin will:

* Add a cookie banner to the top/bottom of all pages on your website, notifying visitors that you have a clearly defined privacy and cookie policy.
* Allow you to record which cookies your site uses and neatly display a list of these cookies. You can add this list to your Privacy Policy page or Cookie Policy page using a shortcode.
Note: If you connect your site to the CookieYes web app, you have to replace the shortcode with an HTML code.

= What is a cookie notice? =
A cookie notice, also known as a cookie banner, is a message informing visitors about the site's use of cookies. It typically explains what cookies are, why they are used, and how they affect user privacy. It often includes options for users to consent to or manage cookie preferences, ensuring compliance with privacy laws like the GDPR and CCPA. The goal is to provide transparency and allow users to make informed decisions about their data.

= Do visitors now have to accept/refuse cookies in order to use websites? =
No, Only the ‘Necessary’ cookies will be loaded until the user gives consent. 

= Does this plugin stop cookies from being stored? =
Visitors can reject the category of cookies they don't want to be installed. In such cases, all cookies in that category will be blocked for the user.

But if another plugin adds scripts or places a cookie, we have no control. We have no way of knowing what plugins you use or how they work, so blocking/deleting cookies on a WordPress website/blog might possibly/probably break your site. Larger websites with substantial budgets may well invest in such technology, but this plugin aims to help you provide a certain level of compliance without taking drastic action.

= Does this plugin guarantee that I comply with GDPR? =
This plugin can be used to comply with the cookie consent requirements of major data privacy laws such as the GDPR. However, you need to assess your website's use of cookies to confirm that it aligns with GDPR guidelines. If you are seeking specialist legal advice regarding your website, we suggest that you consult a lawyer to understand how you can achieve full GDPR compliance.

= What is GDPR? =
GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation is a comprehensive data protection law in the EU aimed at safeguarding EU individuals' privacy and regulating how organizations handle their personal data. It is also known as DatenSchutz-Grundverordnung or DSGVO in German.

= What is CCPA? =
CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act, a law granting California residents more control over their personal information held by businesses. Businesses must be transparent, offer opt-out options, and ensure data security.

= What is GDPR cookie consent? =
GDPR requires websites to obtain explicit consent from users before storing or accessing cookies on their devices. This is known as GDPR cookie consent.

GDPR mandates cookie consent because cookies allow websites to collect data and track users across multiple sessions. Since this impacts user privacy, consent is required before enabling cookies, especially non-essential cookies like analytics, advertisements, etc.

= What is CCPA compliance? =
CCPA Compliance refers to adherence to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a law designed to protect the privacy rights of California residents. It mandates that businesses handling the personal information of California residents provide certain rights and protections to those individuals. Compliance involves ensuring that businesses meet the CCPA's requirements regarding data collection and processing.

= Does the plugin block cookies before consent? =
Non-essential cookies are automatically blocked until explicit consent is given by users. Essential or strictly necessary cookies are allowed by default to ensure site functionality.

= Can I export or log user consent as per GDPR requirements? =
Yes, you can export a log of all user cookie consent and preferences related to cookies. This helps meet GDPR compliance needs.

= Can the plugin help me generate a GDPR-compliant cookie policy? =
Yes, we provide an easy wizard to customize and generate a GDPR-compliant cookie policy based on your scanned site cookies.
