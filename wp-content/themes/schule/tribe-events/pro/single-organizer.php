/**
 * Single Organizer Template
 * The template for an organizer. By default it displays organizer information and lists 
 * events that occur with the specified organizer.
 *
 * This view contains the filters required to create an effective single organizer view.
 *
 * You can recreate an ENTIRELY new single organizer view by doing a template override, and placing
 * a Single_Organizer.php file in a tribe-events/pro/ directory within your theme directory, which
 * will override the /views/single_organizer.php.
 *
 * You can use any or all filters included in this file or create your own filters in 
 * your functions.php. In order to modify or extend a single filter, please see our
 * readme on templates hooks and filters (TO-DO)
